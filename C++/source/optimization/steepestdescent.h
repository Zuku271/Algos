/*
The method of steepest descent
-------------------
An algorithm for finding the nearest local minimum of a function.
It solves an equation in quadratic form: Ax = b where x is the values we seek.
A is a matrix of size NxN, and b is a vector of N values.

Time complexity
---------------
O(e^-2), where e is an error we can accept (indicates how far we are from solution).

Space complexity
----------------
O(2*N), where N is a size of matrix
